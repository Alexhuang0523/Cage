                Monthly Settlement 
SOLUTION :
        Junket Method       MainHall Method 
              AA1              MAINBANK
              AA2
              AA3
              AA4
JUNKET doesn't consist of MAINBANK (DIRECTLY TO CHAIRMAN/BOSS)
therefore they use AA ACCOUNTS for MONTHLY SETTLEMENT 

AA1 = Outstanding Commission 
AA2 = Early Commission 
AA3 = JV Settlement 
AA4 = Variance (Staff Variance)
ALL AA ACCOUNTS MUST BE SETTLED AT THE END OF THE MONTH
