#      1
                Monthly Settlement 
SOLUTION :
        Junket Method       MainHall Method 
              AA1              MAINBANK
              AA2
              AA3
              AA4
JUNKET doesn't consist of MAINBANK (DIRECTLY TO CHAIRMAN/BOSS)
therefore they use AA ACCOUNTS for MONTHLY SETTLEMENT 

AA1 = Outstanding Commission 
AA2 = Early Commission 
AA3 = JV Settlement 
AA4 = Variance (Staff Variance)
ALL AA ACCOUNTS MUST BE SETTLED AT THE END OF THE MONTH

                    Cash Out 
                    JV Agent 
               Overlapping Results 
 SOLUTION 1 : 
 In situation where MORE THAN ONE GAME for SAME AGENT(PZ) ON 
 THE SAME DAY(21/08/2021) for example :
 
 20/08/2021 22:31 --- 21/08/2021 02:50 FIRST   CASH OUT  
 21/08/2021 19:15 --- 21/08/2021 23:45 SECOND  NOT CASH OUT 
 
 record down the RESULTS FOR FIRST GAME once the FIRST GAME ENDS
 to avoid OVER CASH OUT to AGENT
 SOLUTION 2 : 
 CASH OUT base on JV WIN/LOSS
 

#     4
               Absolute Balance

#      9
        JV (not fixed) 80% : 20%    
            
Cage -- Agent             
Marker quota 250,000

Agent -- Customer * Partially Bet 
Take 250,000 but actual bet 200,000
Chips return 211,000
208,800 Agent + 2,200 cash out 
( Capital - Temporary deposit + Cash out ) 
Actually customer still loss 39,000

Cash out 2,200 not consider JV
Loss on table only condiser JV 80% 20% 
Not + Cash 2,200 Agent will bear this cash out 

If customers lose we still settle for agent, Agent will bear more than 250,000 because of AA3 80% (Redeem marker) 
Possible agent not yet collect money from customers, therefore we need to ask Agent everytime before settlement 


Agent -- Customer * Fully Bet 
Take 200,000 actual bet 200,000
Chips return 204,000
Customer really win 4,000 

Settle 
AA3    3,200 
Cash  800 


End of the month AA3 must be settled by chips 
Agent only settle Marker
